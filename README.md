Guess The Twitter Source
=====================

 3 hour project that I put together after @semil tweeted "Fun app idea: Display real tech headline pulled from Twitter & hide   source. User guesses: Hacker News, The Onion, TechCrunch, Product Hunt?" (https://twitter.com/semil/status/491451396424990721)
 
 Pulls recent tweets from 4 different Twitter feeds (@newsycombinator, @theonion, @techcrunch, @ProductHunt), eliminates links, and randomly selects one tweet from the accounts.
 
 Built on Flask, Python, JavaScript.
 
 To run locally, create a config.py file with your keys:
 (APP_KEY = "",
APP_SECRET = "",
OAUTH_TOKEN = "",
OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = "") and then run your "fl.py" file
